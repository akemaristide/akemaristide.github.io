I am a researcher at the interface between artificial intelligence and programmable networking. My research leverages these two areas to contribute to unleashing the full potential of next-generation networks. My research interests are broadly in the areas of in-network computing, network security, IoT, and distributed systems. 

I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/)'s School of Electronics and Computer Science. Prior to joining Southampton, I was a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the [Computing Infrastructure Group](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/computing/) in the [Department of Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, headed by [Prof. Noa Zilberman](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/noa-zilberman/).

Before joining Oxford, I was a research assistant in the [Networks Data Science Group](https://networks.imdea.org/team/research-groups/networks-data-science-group/) at [IMDEA Networks Institute](https://networks.imdea.org/) in Madrid, Spain, headed by [Prof. Marco Fiore](https://networks.imdea.org/team/imdea-networks-team/people/marco-fiore/).

I obtained my PhD degree in [Telematics Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/phdprogram/telematic-engineering) from [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home) in September 2024. My PhD project was part of the [European Union's Horizon 2020 project "BANYAN"](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/860239) which aimed to bring big data analytics to radio access networks. During my PhD, I visited [Ranplan Wireless](https://www.ranplanwireless.com/gb/) and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom as part of the secondments of the EU project. I also visited the SMART team at [Orange](https://www.orange.com/en) Innovation Networks for another secondment. 

Prior to my PhD studies, I completed an engineering degree at the [University of Yaounde I](https://uy1.uninet.cm/), in Cameroon and a master's 
in electrical and computer engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University Africa](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/index.html), in Rwanda. There, my research was on machine learning for energy-saving optimization in cellular networks.
