Apart from research, I constantly engage in other activities like assisting in teaching courses, supervising labs, performing peer reviews for conferences, and volunteering in conference organizing committees. 

## Teaching

I enjoy teaching. Right from my undergraduate days, I have taken up every teaching
opportunity that has come my way. In the summers of 2014-2016, I was a Physics and Mathematics
teacher at [Intelligentsia Corporation](https://intelligentsiacorporation.cm/), a national centre 
for preparation of fresh high school graduates intending to sit for competitive university entrance exams
into engineering and medical schools in Cameroon. Upon graduation from Engineering school in the summer of 2018,
I took up a full-time mathematics and physics teaching position at Omega Learning Centre, Yaounde, Cameroon, and later transitioned to part-time in January 2019 when I started a new role as Video Surveillance Engineer at Huawei Technologies Company Cameroon Ltd. I continued in that teaching role till the end of the school 
year in May 2019. I later joined [Carnegie Mellon University Africa](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/), Rwanda in July that year for my Master's degree studies. Upon graduation in May 2020, I took up a Graduate Teaching Assistant role under the supervision of Prof. [Patrick McSharry](https://www.mcsharry.net/) and worked with him until March 2021, assisting in three data science courses. I visited the University of Cambridge from Otober 2022 - February 2023 and from September 2023 to February 2024, where I am served as a laboratory assistant for the Hardware Practical Classes supervised by Prof. [Ian Wassell](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ijw24).
